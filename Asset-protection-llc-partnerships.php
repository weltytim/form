It should not be confused with limiting liability, which concerns the ability to stop or constrain liability to the asset. Assets that are shielded from creditors are few (common examples include some estate planning, certain retirement plans and interests in LLCs and limited partnerships, wealth transfers (and even these are not always unreachable)). Assets that are almost always unreachable are those to which one does not hold a legal tender title. In many cases we are able to vest a legal title to any personal assets in a trust, an agent or a nominee. Our goal of asset protection is similar to bankruptcy, and the two practice areas actually go hand-in-hand. When a debtor has none too few assets, the bankruptcy route is preferable. When the debtor has significant assets, asset protection may be the solution.</td>

Are the spouses engaged in activities that are equally likely to result in lawsuits or is one spouse more likely to be sued than the other? If the debtor is an entity, did an individual guarantee the entity's debt? How likely is it that the creditior will be able to pierce the corporate veil or otherwise get the assets of the individual owners? Is there a statute that renders the individual personally liable for the obligations of the entity?</td>
            <td>Are there specific claims or the asset protection is taken as a result of a desire to insulate from lawsuits? If the claim has been reduced to a judgement, what assets does the judgement encumber? Is the claim dischargeable? What is the statute of limitations for bringing the claim?</td>
            <td>How aggressive is the creditor? Is the creditor a government agency? Taxing authority? Some government agencies possess powers of seizure that other government agencies do not.</td>
            <td>To what extent are the assets exempt from the claims of the creditors? For example, the degree of protection offered by the homestead exemption, the exemption of the assets in a qualified plan, i.e. assets in a plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) etc.</td>

Many people with significant funds start planning for wealth transfer long before death, because distributing wealth is often subject to complex taxes that can be avoided by starting early. People without many financial assets should still look into some form of planning to distribute wealth upon death.<br />
